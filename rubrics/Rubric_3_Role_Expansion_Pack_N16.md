- generated_utc: 2026-02-24T05:40:00Z
- objective: Role-specific criteria for evaluating `Rubric_2` quality under `Rubric_3`.
- scope: `Rubric_3` evaluates `Rubric_2` only.

## Role Expansion Index

| Role ID | Role | Rubric_3 focus when scoring Rubric_2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R0 | Executive Sponsor / Business Owner | Authority integrity, risk of governance drift, and decision safety |
| R1 | Product Manager | Prioritization utility and defect ordering quality in meta-judging |
| R2 | Product Architect / Enterprise Architect | Structural consistency and boundary discipline across rubric layers |
| R3 | Engineering Manager | Execution operability and ownership clarity in iteration flow |
| R4 | Software Engineer | Falsifiability and precision of scoring logic |
| R5 | QA / Test Engineer | Adversarial coverage and regression resistance |
| R6 | SRE / Platform Engineer | Replay stability and process reproducibility |
| R7 | Security Engineer / Security Architect | Anti-manipulation hardness and integrity controls |
| R8 | Privacy / Compliance / Legal | Compliance enforceability and evidentiary sufficiency |
| R9 | Data / AI Engineer or Scientist | Measurement validity and drift sensitivity |
| R10 | UX Researcher / Designer | Readability and perceptual trust in rubric communication |
| R11 | Technical Writer / DocOps / PDF Owner | Traceability and publication quality of governance outputs |
| R12 | DevOps / Release Manager | Change-control quality and freeze discipline |
| R13 | Operations / Support / Customer Success | Operational actionability and incident response utility |
| R14 | FinOps / Procurement / Vendor Management | Assurance cost realism without control dilution |
| R15 | Internal Audit / Assurance | Independent adjudication quality and contradiction closure |

## Cross-Role Minimum Sub-Dimensions

Every role evaluation must explicitly score:

1. `Coverage Sufficiency`
2. `Discriminative Anchors`
3. `Evidence Admissibility`
4. `Anti-Gaming Strength`
5. `Delta Efficacy`
6. `Contradiction Closure`

## Scored-Collateral Access Requirements

1. Resolve collateral paths from `collateral/Rubric_2/manifest_iteration_XXX.md`.
2. Record consumed paths in `collateral/Rubric_3/access_log_iteration_XXX.md`.
3. Reject non-zero scores when `collateral_refs` do not map to manifest entries.
4. Require full target-collateral coverage for pass.
