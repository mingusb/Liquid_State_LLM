Build a small, production-quality command-line project in this run directory.

Project request:
1. Implement a Python CLI named `task_notes` that can:
   - add a note
   - list notes
   - delete a note by id
2. Persist data in a local JSON file.
3. Include tests that cover core behavior and one error path.
4. Include a concise `README.md` with usage examples.
5. Keep the code simple, readable, and maintainable.

Expected artifact style:
- Source code repository contents (code + tests + docs).
- Clear evidence that the project works.
