Build a small static website artifact in this run directory.

Project request:
1. Create `index.html` and `styles.css` for a polished one-page launch page.
2. The page must include:
   - a hero section,
   - a three-card features section,
   - a call-to-action section,
   - responsive behavior for mobile and desktop.
3. Keep implementation dependency-free (plain HTML/CSS only).
4. Include a concise `README.md` with run/view instructions.
5. Include a visual quality checklist in `VISUAL_CHECKLIST.md`.

Expected artifact style:
- Website source files plus documentation.
- Clear visual polish and readability.
